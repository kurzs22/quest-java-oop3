# Java 08 : Interface

## Challenge
## I Believe I Can Fly!
In order to practice creating and implementing an interface, first do a Fork of the following repository then clone it locally.

Don't forget to Fork, otherwise you won't be able to push anything! Don't know how to Fork a repository ? Look at this GitHub documentation.

1. Go through the repo and take a look at its content:
* Bird, an abstract class

* Eagle, a class inherited from Bird   

* Swim, an interface    

* Penguin, a class inherited from Bird which implements Swim   

* Nature, which you will compile and run to see how everything works

2. Create a Fly interface.

3. Add the following methods to the Fly interface:

* takeOff with no arguments, and returns nothing    

* ascend which takes an integer meters as an argument, and returns an integer    

* descend which takes an integer meters as an argument, and returns an integer    

* land with no arguments, which returns nothing    

* glide, with no arguments, which returns nothing and has a default behaviour: displaying the text "glides into the air."

4. Make it so that the Fly interface is implemented by the Eagle class.
* You will be able to determine the behaviour of the methods, but each method must display text in the console.    

* If you need a little inspiration, feel free to check out the implementation of Swim in Penguin.

5. Undo the commenting out of the Eagle methods being called in Nature.

6. Compile and test Nature. Once everything works, create a git repository and save it all to GitHub.

7. Share the link of your GitHub repository as your solution.

Example results for running Nature:
```
Hawkeye takes off in the sky.
Hawkeye flies upward, altitude: 120
Hawkeye flies upward, altitude: 150
glides into the air.
Hawkeye flies downward, altitude: 10
Hawkeye is too high, it can't land.
Hawkeye flies downward, altitude: 1
Hawkeye lands on the ground.
```

# Validation criterias
- The GitHub repository contains the file Fly.java.
- Classes and interfaces are named according to OOP conventions including: private attributes, the this keyword, and getters and setters.
- The Eagle class implements the Fly interface.
- The Nature class calls the same methods as an instance of Eagle.
- The Nature class compiles with no errors and displays in the terminal a result similar to the one given above.
